## Minimal express app ##

#### It was created to: ####
1. show how to make ajax request for json data </br>
2. show how to create 2 page app with express </br>

#### Installation: ####

1. Install node.js (make sure npm is accessible via terminal) </br>
2. (sudo) npm install express </br>

#### Run: ####
node server.js

P.S. You can use nodemon module instead, not to re-run server every time you change smth. </br>
For this do '(sudo) npm install -g nodemon'. And then just 'nodemon server.js'. </br>

#### How to use: ####

Go to localhost:3000. </br>
Express.static command will serve you the index.html automatically (you'll see the button). </br>
To go to the second page paste following url: localhost:3000/hello </br>
To get the json push the button. </br>

Cheers!
